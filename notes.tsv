2/11:
Leaving off with try to figure out how to integrate the python script into the snakemake and getting it to run and give the proper output

2/15:
first overlap script has been written but needs troubleshooting

2/16:
overlap file has been output, but it is only counting individual base pairs at a time and also need titles for the columns 
but need the contig sequence to be output as well. Could be in the same file (check for redundancy?)
now gives the full overlap, but need to have it listed as a contig 

3/12:
The overlap list should now be fixed, but now working on the conti list. 
The contig list only considers the sequence that actually extend the fragment and it lists the points of overlap but I can't get the sequence listed in the output to be correct, which is needed for further iterations over the contigs 

3/21:
it is only outputting the overlaps in the forwards direction
not handling the case when the sequencer read spans the entire query and extends on both sides 
the actual extending issue is now solved though 

3/23:
two different jobs running. The first was adding the condition for when the read overlaps the entire query
The second is restructuring the code to reduce the run time by only checking the contig when there is a final overlap file. Instead of checking for every combination of i and j and then only adding the final value

3/24:
The reconstruction worked but only seemed to reduce the runtime by 30-60min
The next step is going to be iterating through the overlap command until it is not adding anymore sequences 
This should be sequence by sequence so we are not continuing to compare the same sequences over and over
Create new files each time with the newly generated contigs to prevent this 

Working on how to generate the combined sequences, also need to update the GitHub

3/25:
See if removing sequences shorter than a certain number of bp does anything
Need to add a parameter for the minimum overlap length
